## LORE
Obstacle Run is a racing car game, where you're stuck inside a box on a infinite track, why the track are infinite?
Because you can't die, when you fall on the abism, the box active his mecanism and teleport you at the beginning, thus preventing your death,
and when the time is over, the box going to do the same.

But you aren't alone, when you turn it over, you can ask for help to the gods. But since the box only allows 1% power of the gods,
they will just help you by turning you around very poorly, only on the same direction, with the few magical powers they can use on you.

The only form to ecape is overcome the obstacles on a limit time, and escape from the box.
