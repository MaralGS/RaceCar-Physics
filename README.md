## LORE
Obstacle Run is a racing car game, where you're stuck inside a box on a infinite track, why the track is infinite?
Because you can't die, when you fall on the abism, the box active his mecanism and teleport you at the beginning, preventing your death,
and if the time ends, the box would do the same.

But you are not alone, when you turn it over, you can ask for help to the gods. But since the box only allows 1% power of the gods,
they will just help you by turning you around very poorly, only on the same direction, with the few magical powers they can use on you.

The only form to ecape is overcome the obstacles on a limit time, and you will escape from the box.

That's what you thought buajajajajaja!!! After 10 seconds, the gods that just want entertainment watching your suffering,
will return you at the beginning creating a loop you will never be able to get out.
